    """ Room occupancy data
        Dataset on detecting room occupancy based on several variables. For our dataset we use the Temperature, Humidity, Light, and CO2 variables from the training dataset.

        This dataset is obtained from the UCI repository on 2019-06-10. As it is unclear whether the data can be redistributed as part of this repository, we download it locally instead.

        The data is sampled at every 16 observations to reduce the length of the series.
