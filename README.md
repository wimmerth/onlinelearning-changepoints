# Benchmarking Online Change Point Detection Algorithms with River

This repository contains code to be integrated into the open-source ML library [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river).
The project is the final contribution for the class "Data Science in Practice" at TELECOM Paris and aims at integrating the [TCPD Benchmark](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TCPDBench) into River.
The project was carried out together with Jules Soria.

The repository also includes basic code for online calibration of ML methods (not finalized) and an adaption of the WATCH change point classifier for River (written by Haileleul Haile, Maximilien Chau and Lola Deng).
